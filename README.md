Design for an E-clipless Shaft for use with the Phreakmods Link and Link EX Groove on Sanwa JLF and Sanjuks V3 levers
Fits an M4x10mm Screw

Based on measurements taken from my own Phreakmods Link Shaft, Sanjuks V3P shaft, and https://github.com/BolSadguy/Link-Holder-2.0

STEP and PDF files are required for CNC fabrication using JLCCNC
