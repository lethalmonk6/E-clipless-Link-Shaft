Design for an E-clipless Shaft for use with the Phreakmods Link / Link EX Groove on Sanwa JLF and Sanjuks V3 levers

Fits an M4x10mm Screw

Based on measurements taken from my own Phreakmods Link Shaft, Sanjuks V3P shaft, and https://github.com/BolSadguy/Link-Holder-2.0


STEP and PDF files are required for CNC fabrication using JLCCNC
