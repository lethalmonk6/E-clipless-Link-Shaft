# E-clipless Link Shaft
Design for an E-clipless Shaft for use with the Phreakmods Link / Link EX Groove on Sanwa JLF and Sanjuks V3 levers

Fits an M4x10mm Screw.

Revised to include slot at the top for a slotted screwdriver.

Based on measurements taken from my own Phreakmods Link Shaft, Sanjuks V3P shaft, and https://github.com/BolSadguy/Link-Holder-2.0

STEP and PDF files are required for CNC fabrication using JLCCNC. 
Material is Aluminum 6061-T6, no surface finish, ISO 2768 medium tolerance.
